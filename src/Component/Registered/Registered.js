            <p>You hold your hand in front of your face to block the bright light that is shining into your eyes.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, the light winks out and you sense more than see a figure standing where the light once blazed. Before you can say anything, the figure raps the ground with a wooden object, probably a staff of some kind.</p>
            <p>"Well, well, young one. I see that you are finally aware again." The voice creaks like an ancient wooden floor but, somehow, still sounds strong. "It is well that you are awake. We have much to discuss."</p>
            <p>You hold your hand up and ask, "Where am I? Who are you?"</p>
            <p>The figure takes a few steps forward. You can see that it is a very old man wearing a loose fitting gi around his hunched frame. He also has an obviously worn <i>sugegasa</i> upon his head. Resting quite firmly in his grip is a long brown staff that is forked on one end and polished on the other.</p>
            <p>"Ah, that is a fine question." He strokes his long white beard that hangs only slightly longer than his white bushy eyebrows. "I am Toshi-sensei. And you have entered the <i>Tatakai no Sekai</i>...the World of Battle."</p>
            <p>"The World of Battle? How did I get here?" You ask, slightly confused by it all.</p>
            <p>Toshi-sensei waves his hand as if the question is unimportant. "What you really should be asking, #userName, is now that you are here, what is next?"</p>
